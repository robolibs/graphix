# Graphix

A modern C++20 library unifying traditional graph algorithms with factor graphs for optimization and probabilistic inference.

**Two front-ends, one kernel**: `graphix::Vertice` for classic graph operations and `graphix::Factor` for GTSAM-style factor graphs, both built on a shared efficient kernel.
